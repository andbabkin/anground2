# Tour of Skills

While learning Angular 6 I've created this small SPA describing my development skills.
It's named in analogy to Angular Tutorial ["Tour of Heroes"](https://angular.io/tutorial).

This web application is still a testing ground for awesome features of Angular 6 
and additional packages which can work with it.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.
